# ArNS service UI

This application is intended to provide contract exploration and interaction tools using engineering concepts taken from sonar.warp.cc and etherscan.io. It is a block explorer and
contract inspection/development tool.

The main focus is to provide developers and creators access to information revolving around their smartweave contracts to better understand ecosystem impact and usage of the contracts,
as well as provide superusers access to testing the contracts in a codeless manner (such as the 'write' ability etherscan provides).
